			<h3><p>This website is to explain all three spider-man movies from Spider-man to Spider-Man: No Way Home. It will basically explain how different Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland characters and backgrounds are different and how difficult it was for them with these Spider-man movies.</p>
	<blockquote cite="https://thedirect.com/article/spider-man-andrew-garfield-no-way-home-idea-first">"They asked me to do it, and Tobey was doing it and I'm... if Tobey's doing it then I gotta do it.... He's my Spider-Man. I would practice his lines in the mirror when I was in drama school."
