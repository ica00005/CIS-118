			<h3>I first watched Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man movie and I was fascinate about and I watched Spider-Man 2 and 3 and then watched Andrew Garifield's Spider-Man Movies and finally watched the last movies of Tom Holland Spider-Man. Since their was three diffrent Spider-Man actors I wanted to make a porject explainig the difference between all their movies and background. I wanted to be honest so I used sources explaining what the websites explains and tell what website it is. I gave links to the website to show what other people say about the three actors. Alot of people had alot website of the Spider-Man and their opinions.</h3>
