<h3 style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid red;">I first watched Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man movie and I was fascinate about and I watched Spider-Man 2 and 3 and then watched Andrew Garifield's Spider-Man Movies and finally watched the last movies of Tom Holland Spider-Man. Since their was three diffrent Spider-Man actors I wanted to make a porject explainig the difference between all their movies and background. I wanted to be honest so I used sources explaining what the websites explains and tell what website it is. I gave links to the website to show what other people say about the three actors. Alot of people had alot website of the Spider-Man and their opinions.</h3>

<h3 style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid red;">Another reason people should trust me because I validated my sources by giving the links and showing who made them. I also remade my whole assignment to see what I can do with this type of work without just copying and pasting. I just wanted to be honest with everything so, people can trust me and people don't think I'm just going to steal's someone's work. I want to be reliable.</h3>

<h3 style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid red;">I just want to be reliable, so when I do this in the future I know the right way to do it. The only reason I did Spider-Man was because of the Spider-Man: No Way Home movie that came out last year and everybody was talking about it, it was a massive hit. I know their's big fans out their that likes to look at something to do with Spider-Man or read about Spider-Man.</h3>
